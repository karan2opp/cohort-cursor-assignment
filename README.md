🚀 Project Overview

This project is a frontend clone of Cursor’s official website — a modern AI-powered code editor designed to improve developer productivity.

The goal of this project was to recreate the dark-themed landing page UI using pure HTML and CSS, focusing on layout structure, typography, hover effects, and section-based design architecture.
